Global solar irradiation is an important variable that can be used to determine 
the suitability of an area to install solar systems; nevertheless, due to the 
limitations of requiring measurement stations around the entire world, it can 
be correlated with different meteorological parameters. To confront this issue, 
different locations in Rias Baixas (Autonomous Community of Galicia, Spain) and 
combinations of parameters (month and average temperature, among others) were 
used to develop various machine learning models (random forest -RF-, support 
vector machine -SVM- and artificial neural network -ANN-). These three approaches 
were used to model and predict (one month ahead) monthly global solar irradiation 
using the data from six measurement stations. Afterwards, these models were 
applied to seven different measurement stations to check if the knowledge 
acquired could be extrapolated to other locations. In general, the ANN models 
offered the best results for the development and testing phases of the model, 
as well as for the phase of knowledge extrapolation to other locations. In this 
sense, the selected ANNs obtained a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value 
between 3.9 and 13.8% for the model development and an overall MAPE between 4.1 
and 12.5% for the other seven locations. ANNs can be a capable tool for modelling 
and predicting monthly global solar irradiation in areas where data are available 
and for extrapolating this knowledge to nearby areas.
