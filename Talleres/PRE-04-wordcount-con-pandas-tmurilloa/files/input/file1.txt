Analytics refers to the systematic computational analysis of data 
or statistics, typically for the purpose of gaining insights, 
making informed decisions, and discovering patterns or trends. It 
encompasses a broad range of techniques and methodologies aimed at
extracting meaningful information from raw data, often involving 
processes such as data collection, cleaning, transformation, 
modeling, and interpretation. Analytics can be applied across 
various domains including business, finance, healthcare, marketing, 
and science, among others, to uncover hidden patterns, predict 
future outcomes, optimize processes, and drive strategic 
decision-making. It relies heavily on mathematical and statistical 
principles, as well as computational tools and technologies, to 
derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
