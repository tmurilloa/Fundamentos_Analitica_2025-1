Business intelligence (BI) refers to the technologies, strategies, 
and practices utilized by organizations to analyze and interpret 
raw data in order to make informed business decisions. It involves
collecting, organizing, and transforming data into actionable 
insights that drive strategic planning, operational improvements, 
and competitive advantages. BI encompasses various processes, 
including data mining, data visualization, statistical analysis, 
and predictive modeling, all aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, 
and correlations within data sets. By harnessing BI tools and 
methodologies, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their 
operations, customer behaviors, market dynamics, and emerging 
opportunities or risks. Ultimately, business intelligence empowers 
organizations to optimize performance, mitigate risks, and adapt 
swiftly to changing market conditions, fostering agility and 
innovation in today's dynamic business landscape.
